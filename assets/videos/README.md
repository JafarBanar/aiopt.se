## Video Hosting

Due to GitHub's file size limitations (100MB max), videos should be hosted externally and referenced via URL.

### Recommended Video Hosting Options:
1. **YouTube** - Upload as unlisted and embed
2. **Vimeo** - Professional video hosting
3. **Cloudflare Stream** - Fast global delivery
4. **AWS S3** - For enterprise solutions

### Current Video:
- `aiopt-demo.mp4` - Main demo video (needs external hosting)

### Usage:
Update the video source in `index.html` to point to the hosted video URL.
